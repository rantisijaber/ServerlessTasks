# Serverless Task Manager

A fully serverless REST API built on AWS using Node.js, designed to manage tasks efficiently without managing servers.

---

## Overview

This project implements a scalable, cost-effective task management backend using AWS services:

- **API Gateway** to expose RESTful HTTP endpoints  
- **AWS Lambda** functions to run your backend business logic in a serverless environment  
- **Amazon DynamoDB** for fast, flexible NoSQL data storage and retrieval  

The architecture allows you to focus on your application logic while AWS handles infrastructure, scaling, and availability.

## Project Structure

- **API Gateway:** Manages HTTP requests and routes them to Lambda functions.  
- **Lambda Functions:** Stateless compute logic written in Node.js, triggered by API Gateway events.  
- **DynamoDB:** Stores task data as key-value/document entries, optimized for fast reads/writes.
